However, like any language, mastering Python requires dedication and practice. With a structured learning plan and consistent effort, beginners can often grasp the basics in a few weeks and become somewhat proficient in a few months.\n",

While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38].

Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [15, 13].

This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output.

These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q,a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2021-04-13T00:48:38+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020) kpathsea version 6.3.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': './data/rag-paper.pdf', 'total_pages': 19, 'page': 17, 'page_label': '18'}, page_content='sions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes.

The retrieval system fetches relevant documents or passages from external knowledge sources, giving the LLM access to more up-to-date and accurate information than what it has learned during training. This allows RAG to generate responses that are grounded in factual data, reducing the risk of hallucination and improving the model's accuracy, especially in niche or specialized domains where the LLM alone may lack expertise. By leveraging both external knowledge and the generative abilities of LLMs, RAG enhances the quality, relevance, and factuality of the answers provided.\""
